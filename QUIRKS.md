# Broadcast desktop UI quirks

Desktop pass on the Broadcast app, which is `run.html` wearing `#bc=1` (the Meeting page’s broadcast skin). Branch `cursor/qa-broadcast-desktop` off `release/0.9.23`.

Driven locally with Playwright in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. Viewports: 1280×720, 1920×1080, a 900×720 window, and live resizes between them. Personas: webinar producer, keyboard-only user, full-screen viewer, busy-chat moderator, someone who joins and leaves.

Geometry below is from `getBoundingClientRect` in Chromium unless a browser is named. Screenshot descriptions from a vision pass were checked against pixels; where they disagreed, the pixels won.

## Fixed

### Q25. A Watching viewer still had Video and Unmute

The dock hid microphone and camera only under `body.notadmin`. A viewer session paints Watching without that class, so Video and Unmute stayed on the dock and a click called `getUserMedia` twice. The hide is now `body.bc-watching`, set from the watching seat itself (not the host, and not a stage grant). Clicks and `lateMedia` return before they publish. A host still has the buttons. The labeled-dock check runs as the host. Permanent repro: `test/e2e/broadcast-desktop.spec.js` (“a Watching viewer has no camera or mic…”).

### Q1. Chat composer slides under the control dock at 900px

The chat panel now keeps a band clear of the dock (`padding-bottom: 128px`, `112px` when the dock is the shorter phone size). At 900×720 the composer ends at y=592 and the dock starts at y=602, so attach, the message field, and send are all clear. The same holds after a live resize from 1920×1080 to 900×720.

Permanent repro: `test/e2e/broadcast-desktop.spec.js` (“chat composer stays clear…”). Passed on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. Before: `test/e2e/artifacts/chat-900-before.png`. After: `test/e2e/artifacts/chat-900-after.png`.

### Q2. A broadcast still talks like a meeting

`paintBroadcastChrome()` rewrites the in-room words when `body.broadcast` is set: chat title, privacy line, leave button, leave dialog, Help, Who, record, invite, and pinned files. A plain meeting stays “Meeting chat” / “Leave the meeting?”. Switching the chat panel to the transcript and back restores “Broadcast chat”, not “Meeting chat”.

### Q3. No Live / Watching state

The top chip now carries `#onair`. A host (stored admin key, or signed-in admin) sees a filled red **Live** pill. Everyone else in the broadcast sees **Watching**. Meetings hide the pill. It stays inside the viewport at 1280 and at 900. Screenshots: `test/e2e/artifacts/onair-live-1280.png`, `test/e2e/artifacts/onair-watching-900.png`.

Both are in `test/e2e/broadcast-desktop.spec.js` and passed on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.

### Q5. Primary dock controls are icon-only

Mic, camera, reactions, and More now carry a visible word inside the button (`Unmute` / `Mute` / `Video` / `React` / `More`). Off is filled red `#b61622` with white text; on is filled green. The word stays inside the 68px circle at 1280, 1920, and 900, and the dock stays inside the window after a resize from 1920 to 900. Screenshots: `test/e2e/artifacts/dock-labels-1280.png`, `test/e2e/artifacts/dock-labels-900.png`.

### Q6. No mute / camera keyboard shortcuts

`M` toggles the mic and `V` toggles the camera, except while focus is in a text field. The chat test types `m` into the composer and the mic stays on Unmute. The buttons’ titles name the shortcut.

### Q4. More sheet can leave the viewport

`#barmore` now has `max-height: calc(100dvh - 140px)` and `overflow-y: auto`. At 1280×360 the sheet used to start at y=−142 with Who, Invite, and the blur segments off screen and no scroll. It now stays inside the viewport, and Help can be scrolled into view. Screenshot: `test/e2e/artifacts/more-sheet-short-after.png`.

### Q11. Invite was a second tap inside More

`#invite` lived in `#barmore`, so with the dock collapsed (the default) its box was 0×0. It is now a labeled circle on the dock, between React and More, visible while More is closed. One tap opens “Share this broadcast”. The word Invite stays inside the 68px circle, and the dock stays inside 1280, 1920, and 900. The button is the same neutral gray as React and More (`rgb(232, 236, 241)`), so blue stays reserved for an open popover. Before: `test/e2e/artifacts/invite-dock-before.png` (and the buried control in `invite-more-before.png`). After: `test/e2e/artifacts/invite-dock-after.png`, `invite-modal-after.png`.

### Q12. Reactions were words, and the dock face was easy to misread

The reaction tray is now emoji: ✋ 👏 👍 👎 😂, with accessible names Raise hand, Clap, Yes, No, Laugh. A clap paints 👏 on your tile, not the word Clap. The dock control shows 😊 plus the word React. No sparkle glyph (✨ ✦ ✧ ⭐) is on this control; that mark stays available for AI. Before: `test/e2e/artifacts/react-tray-before.png`. After: `test/e2e/artifacts/react-tray-after.png`.

### Q7. Reactions and More occupied the same slot

Opening React while More was open put `#reacttray` on top of `#barmore` (overlap 392×88px at 1280×720). Opening one now closes the other. After the same two taps, More is `display: none` and the emoji tray is the only popover. Before: `test/e2e/artifacts/react-more-stack-before.png`. After: `test/e2e/artifacts/react-more-stack-after.png`.

### Q10. Full screen lived only on the tile

The dock now has `#fsbtn`, labeled Full, with the accessible name “Full screen”. It sits between Invite and More, visible while More is closed, and the dock stays inside 1280, 1920, and 900 (the bar measured 626px wide at 1280). One tap opens the filmstrip view (`body.fsopen`) following the speaker; the view’s close button leaves it. The tile glyph `⛶` is still there for a single feed. Before: `test/e2e/artifacts/dock-fullscreen-before.png`. After: `test/e2e/artifacts/dock-fullscreen-after.png`, `fullscreen-view-after.png`.

### Q8. Guest moderation tools were hover-first

A guest tile is now in the tab order (`tabindex="0"`, named “Jordan Lee. Guest controls.”). Focusing it shows Mute, Blur, and, for a host, Apps, Share, and Ban. Tab reaches Mute and then Ban. The words fit the buttons; the longer phrase stays on the accessible name (“Mute for everyone”). Before: `test/e2e/artifacts/modbar-keyboard-before.png`. After: `test/e2e/artifacts/modbar-keyboard-after.png`.

A broadcast hides the gallery, so this bar is the meeting surface. The same tools are painted on the broadcast stage (Q15).

### Q15. Guest tools were missing from the broadcast stage

A broadcast hides the gallery, so Mute, Blur, and Ban had nothing to sit on. The host now sees them on the stage: “On stage”, the guest’s name, and the same words. Tab reaches Mute, and Mute becomes Unmute. A viewer does not get the strip. The tools stay inside the picture area and clear of the dock at 1280 and 900. After: `test/e2e/artifacts/stage-mod-after.png`.

### Q14. The dock grip promised arrow keys and ignored them

The grip’s title says “Arrow keys nudge.” Arrow keys now move the dock 24px (48px with Shift). It stays 8px inside the window. A double click, or a double tap, puts it back in the center. Before: `test/e2e/artifacts/dock-grip-before.png`. After: `test/e2e/artifacts/dock-grip-after.png`.

### Q9. Lobby copy was one voice, and the password essay came first

A meeting lobby’s blue button is **Start a call** (“Anyone with the link can join”). **Host this call** is an outline button. The guest password stays hidden until “Add a password for guests”. A broadcast lobby’s blue button is **Go live**; the viewer password stays hidden until “Add a password for viewers”. The card stays inside 1280, 1920, and 900. The words “troublemaker”, “open room”, and “admin” are gone from the lobby. Before: `test/e2e/artifacts/lobby-simple-before.png`, `lobby-family-before.png`. After: `lobby-family-after.png`, `lobby-simple-after.png`, `lobby-golive-after.png`.

### Q13. The screen-name step skipped a saved name

Joining now shows “This is how you'll appear” with the GifOS display name filled in and the saved picture in the circle. The person can edit the name and choose another picture. Save is blue `#0064c8` and keeps the name and picture on screen. Clear is a white button with a gray outline and blanks both. The two do not touch (gap at least 8px). The lobby shows the same preview, so a call started from there does not ask twice. A direct link still asks. Before: the old lobby line “You'll join as …” in `lobby-family-after.png` from the previous round. After: `test/e2e/artifacts/appear-lobby-after.png`, `appear-dialog-after.png`.

### Q16. On air was a small pill

The top chip still says Live or Watching. A full-width bar under that chip now says **You are live** (red `#b61622`) or **You are watching** (light gray). It clears the chip, the Fit button, and the dock at 1280, 1920, and 900. A meeting hides it. After: `test/e2e/artifacts/onair-bar-live-after.png`, `onair-bar-watch-after.png`. The small pill in `onair-live-1280.png` is the earlier state.

### Q17. Chat lived in More, and a prayer looked like any other line

Chat is a labeled dock button, so it is one tap while More is closed. The dock still fits 1280, 1920, and 900. Prayer marks the composer (“Prayer request…”) and the sent line wears the word Prayer, separate from an ordinary message. The composer still clears the dock. After: `test/e2e/artifacts/chat-dock-after.png`, `chat-prayer-after.png`.

### Q18. An open room did not say whether it was a service or a small group

The full-width bar now names the room. A service says **Service · You are live** (red `#b61622`) or **Service · You are watching** (gray `#e8ecf1`). A small group says **Small group** on green `#143024`. Chat, leave, invite, Help, and the tab title use the same words. The lobby still says Start a call or Go live. The two bars do not share a background, and both clear the chip, the Fit button, and the dock at 1280, 1920, and 900. Before: the Q16 bars, which only said “You are live” / “You are watching”, and a meeting that hid the bar. After: `test/e2e/artifacts/service-bar-live-after.png`, `service-bar-watch-after.png`, `small-group-bar-after.png`.

### Q19. Recording and who is here were inside More

The room bar now says **Not recording** or **Recording**, and a headcount (**1 here**) that opens the name list. More can stay closed. Recording is a white pill with red text. Not recording is an outline on the same bar. Both fit inside the bar at 1280, 1920, and 900, clear of the dock. Tapping Not recording opens the record sheet. Tapping the count shows the names, including your own. A service keeps “Service · You are live” beside those controls. After: `test/e2e/artifacts/trust-group-after.png`, `trust-group-recording-after.png`, `trust-service-after.png`.

### Q20. Leave was an unlabeled phone icon, and coming back said “meeting”

The dock button says **Leave**. The question is Stay (outline) and Leave (red), with a gap between them. After you leave, a white card says **You left the small group** or **You left the service**. Rejoin is blue `#0064c8`. Close is a white outline button. Rejoin reloads the same link and the room bar is back. The label fits inside the button at 1280, 1920, and 900. After: `test/e2e/artifacts/leave-dock-after.png`, `leave-ask-after.png`, `leave-rejoin-after.png`.

### Q21. Mute and camera were only a dock color

A full-width line under the room bar says **Microphone off** and **Camera off** while those are off. White on `#3a1014`. It sits under the room bar, clears the dock, and fits 1280, 1920, and 900. It hides when the microphone and camera are on. Someone only watching a service does not see it. After: `test/e2e/artifacts/av-off-after.png`, `av-on-after.png`.

### Q22. A recording started without a card you had to read

Starting a recording, or seeing someone else start one, opens a white card. The title is **You are recording this small group**, **You are recording this service**, **Jordan Lee is recording this small group**, or **This small group is being recorded** when the name is missing. The body says it is saved on a device in this room and that the bar keeps saying Recording. OK is blue `#0064c8`. The card fits 1280, 1920, and 900. OK dismisses the card and leaves the bar on Recording. The record sheet says the same thing: Cancel is an outline, Start recording is blue. After: `test/e2e/artifacts/rec-notice-after.png`.

### Q23. Invite opened onto a governance essay

Invite is a dock button. The sheet is now a white card. A small group says **Share this small group** and **Send this link. Anyone who opens it joins you.** Copy is blue `#0064c8`. Close is an outline. The gap between the link and Copy is 12px. **A room you run** is a text link; the host password stays hidden until that tap. A service says **Share this service** and that people who open the link are watching. A host also sees that the host password stays with them. The card fits 1280, 1920, and 900, including after a live resize to 900, and the password step still fits. Before: `test/e2e/artifacts/invite-sheet-before.png`. After: `test/e2e/artifacts/invite-sheet-after.png`.

### Q24. The full-screen control said Full

The dock button now says **Full screen**. The word fits inside the button at 1280, 1920, and 900, and after a live resize from 1920 to 900. The dock stays inside the window. Before: `test/e2e/artifacts/dock-full-before.png`. After: `test/e2e/artifacts/dock-full-after.png`.

## Open

A recording card names who is recording, and the bar stays Recording (Q22). Trust stays short of Zoom and Teams: there is no waiting room, and the card does not hold the recording until the other people have answered. FaceTime is still ahead on how little chrome a personal call shows, and on leaving without a confirm step. The lobby, the labeled controls, the layout, and chat are the corporate rows still at 4. Labeled controls stay at 4: the words are complete, and Zoom’s bar is still the reference.

## How a session was opened without a relay

`run.html#mb=1&v=<room>&av=<16+ hex>&bc=1` adds `body.meet-session` and `body.broadcast` without knocking the network. Hash-only navigations do not re-run boot; tests must load that URL as a full navigation.
