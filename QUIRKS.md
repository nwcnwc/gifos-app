# Broadcast and meeting mobile quirks

Role-play pass on `run.html` (Broadcast is this page with `#bc=1`). Served locally and driven with Playwright Chromium, touch, mobile emulation.

Devices: iPhone SE (320×568), iPhone 15 (393×659), Pixel 7 (412×839), a 360×740 Android, each in portrait and landscape.

Personas: church volunteer starting a broadcast, late viewer on a shared link, flaky connection, low-vision at a 32px root font, broadcaster who needs to flip cameras.

Screenshots for the open bugs are in `test/mobile/screenshots/before/`.

## Open

### Q5b. Flip camera stays hidden until two cameras are enumerated

`#flipcam` is `display: none` until `enumerateDevices` reports more than one video input. A phone host does not get a flip control up front, including mid-service when they rotate the handset. Camera and mic stay hidden for a broadcast viewer, which is intended.

### Q6. 200% root font does not grow the status line

`document.documentElement.style.fontSize = '32px'`. Lobby actions use `rem` and grow. `.topchip .status` stays `17px` (`20px` only on the wide landscape dock). The in-call status is the line a low-vision viewer has to read for reconnecting versus alone.

### Q7. No safe-area insets

The viewport meta is `width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, interactive-widget=resizes-content`. The dock is `bottom: calc(14px + var(--kb, 0px))` and the top chip is `top: 14px`. Neither uses `env(safe-area-inset-*)`, and the meta does not set `viewport-fit=cover`. On a notched phone the chip and the dock sit under the hardware.

## Fixed

### Q1. Hang up is off the screen on a 320px and 360px phone

Measured on a meeting (`#v=sundayroom`), portrait. Leave’s right edge was 374px on both a 320px iPhone SE and a 360px Android. The dock is `width: auto` with `overflow: visible`, so the red hang-up control was only a sliver.

Below 380px the dock now uses 44px primary controls and a 48px Leave, all inside the screen. `test/mobile/dock-fit.spec.mjs` covers iPhone SE, iPhone 15, Pixel 7, and the 360px Android.

### Q2. The chat field sits under the dock

Same meeting, chat opened. The message field overlapped the dock on every phone in the pass, portrait and landscape. Send was 34px tall. On iPhone SE an overlaid keyboard (visual viewport at 46% of the layout height) pushed the field into the dock again until the phone header stopped wrapping.

The composer now sits in the band above the dock (`--dock-clear`), Send and the field are at least 44px, and a `visualViewport` shrink lifts both the dock and the field. `test/mobile/chat-dock.spec.mjs`.

### Q8. Chat header spent a third of a short screen

`#chathead` wrapped the title, the privacy sentence, Transcript, and close into about 110px on iPhone SE. On a phone the sentence is now clipped for sighted layout and kept for screen readers, and Transcript / close are 44px. That was required for Q2: the tall header pushed Send under the dock once the keyboard opened.

### Q3. More sheet started above the viewport in landscape

Meeting, More open. On iPhone SE landscape the sheet top was −194px (the earlier pass measured −8px with a shorter sheet). iPhone 15, Pixel 7, and the 360px Android landscape did the same. The sheet now has a max height that clears the dock and the top of the screen, and the rest scrolls. `test/mobile/more-sheet.spec.mjs`.

### Q4. “Create & enter” was below the fold on every phone

Broadcast lobby (`#bc=1`), Start broadcasting expanded. The create button’s top was past the viewport on iPhone SE (y ≈ 853, viewport 568), iPhone 15, Pixel 7, and 360, portrait and landscape. Opening the form now parks the rest of the lobby, shrinks the preview on a short or narrow screen, and keeps Cancel / Create in the card while the fields scroll. `test/mobile/create-on-screen.spec.mjs`.

### Q5. No LIVE / OFF AIR / WATCHING signal

A broadcast had only the status sentence. A viewer sat on “Joining the broadcast…”. A host with the camera off had no off-air mark. The chip now shows RECONNECTING while the room is not reached, OFF AIR for a host who is not sending a picture, LIVE once that picture is on, and WATCHING for a viewer who is in. Meetings do not wear it. `test/mobile/live-badge.spec.mjs`.
