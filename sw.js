/*
 * sw.js — the GifOS offline layer.
 *
 * GifOS is already a local-first computer: all the logic ships as static files,
 * and every app + file you own lives in IndexedDB on the device. The one thing
 * that still needed the network was FETCHING THOSE STATIC FILES on each load —
 * so a fresh open in airplane mode never even reached the desktop. This service
 * worker precaches the whole shell (the HTML pages, CSS, every js/ module and
 * the base theme) so the desktop boots with no connection at all. Your saved
 * apps then run straight from IndexedDB, exactly as they do online.
 *
 * What still needs a connection (and degrades on its own, unchanged): Meetings
 * (the relay), the web-reading apps like Bible Browser and Fortune (the CORS
 * proxy), and Ask AI. Those are CROSS-ORIGIN requests — the fetch handler never
 * touches them, so they fail the same friendly way they always did offline.
 *
 * Update path — TWO policies, split by channel (the fetch handler decides by URL:
 * /versions/ is a release, everything else is the edge root):
 *
 *  - RELEASE / pinned users live entirely under /versions/<x.y.z>/, which are
 *    IMMUTABLE snapshots: cache-first forever, NO background revalidation. Updates
 *    are OPT-IN and never happen behind their back — a plain (or hard) refresh
 *    serves the SAME installed shell, and a new sw.js installs but WAITS (it does
 *    not skipWaiting over an existing shell). The desktop learns a release exists
 *    by fetching version.json + changelog.json network-first, and shows it in
 *    Settings → Advanced → Version with a changelog (critical items called out).
 *    Only when the user chooses "Upgrade this computer" does the page activate the
 *    waiting worker or send 'gifos-refresh-shell' to re-fetch the ENTIRE shell
 *    fresh (the computer is far more than index.html) and reload.
 *
 *  - EDGE users (localStorage gifos_channel='edge') are served from the site ROOT
 *    and have asked to track the newest build on GitHub Pages. Root assets are
 *    therefore NETWORK-FIRST with revalidation: every load issues a conditional GET
 *    (If-None-Match / If-Modified-Since), so a changed file is regrabbed and an
 *    unchanged one comes back 304 and reuses the cached bytes (no re-download —
 *    "caching is fine if the files haven't changed"). Offline or a stalled socket
 *    falls back to cache, so edge still boots and still works in airplane mode.
 *    sw-register.js lets a freshly-installed worker take over on its own for edge
 *    (no forced reload, so a live meeting is never interrupted) so this strategy
 *    itself reaches existing edge users without a manual upgrade step.

// blocking <script>, and a transient 5xx should serve the last good build.
// `passRouted` — a NAVIGATION whose server answer is not 200 but IS still the
// answer must be delivered as-is, never papered over. Two shapes qualify, and
// falling back to the cached shell for either one breaks a pretty link:
//
//  - 404. On GitHub Pages the 404 body IS 404.html: the pretty-link router that
//    turns /meet/<room> and /join/<code> into a real page. Resolving null for it
//    sent the caller to the cached shell instead, whose channel loader then
//    rewrote the pretty path to /versions/<v>/meet/<room> — a path that exists
//    nowhere — and every invite link landed on the desktop with the meeting
//    silently dropped.
//  - A REDIRECT. Pages 301s every directory URL typed without its trailing slash
//    (/go/<slug> → /go/<slug>/, and likewise /store, /themes/<x>). A navigation
//    Request carries redirect:'manual', which the clone below PRESERVES, so that
//    301 arrives here as an OPAQUEREDIRECT: type 'opaqueredirect', status 0, ok
//    false. It reads as a failure and is not one. Swallowing it walked the exact
//    same path as the 404 bug — cached shell → /versions/<v>/go/<slug> → nowhere
//    → bare desktop, app silently dropped — while the slashed form worked, which
//    is what made it look like the LINK was broken. Handing the opaqueredirect
//    back lets the browser follow it (that is what manual redirects are for);
//    respondWith accepts one precisely because this is a navigation.
//
// Only those pass through, so a transient 5xx still falls back to the last good
// build as intended.
//
// A 404 for an ASSET is also the answer, and it is delivered as one. The server
// said the file is gone; turning that into the cached copy would serve a
// deleted file forever, and turning it into degrade()'s empty 200 (which used
// to happen ONLINE, for any missing script or stylesheet) told a fetch() caller
// "ok" with nothing in it. The cached copy is dropped at the same time. The
// empty 200 remains what an offline, uncached parser-blocking load gets — that
