/*
 * mesh-wire.js — binds the mesh control plane (mesh.js, the ported sim brain)
 * to the REAL transports. This is the layer run.html consumes: it owns the
 * relay socket (knock/greeters + sealed peer-message fallback) and prefers the
 * caller's DataChannel layer for seat-to-seat control traffic.
 *
 * The canonical TIME mapping: 1 tick = 500ms. All of mesh.js's timers are in
 * ticks, so phone-home = 8 ticks = the 4s HB pulse, heal fires at ~20s,
 * drain at ~40s, R6 strand at 250s. Tests shrink tickMs to run fast.
 *
 * Everything seat-to-seat is SEALED under the room key (deriveMeetKey — the
 * password is mixed in). The greeter address blob a Section-1 seat registers
 * is a real Seal(key, address) — address = {p: peerId, c: coord} — so a knocker
 * that opens it learns WHERE the greeter sits, not just who; a knocker that
 * can't decrypt any blob has the wrong password (R6) — surfaced via onLocked,
 * never sent to the relay.
 *
 * FOUNDING is decided by the relay's `founded` flag, not list emptiness: a
 * founder is admitted to the registry at KNOCK time but registers its sealed
 * address a beat later (sealing is async), so a second knocker in that gap
 * sees an EMPTY list with founded:false. Delivering that to the seat would
 * mint a SECOND founder — instead the wire holds it and the join loop retries.
 * (The sim's registry listed knocker IDS, so identity WAS the address and the
 * gap didn't exist; production separates them, so the flag closes it.)
 *
 * SOCKET LIFECYCLE (user decision): a seat holds a relay socket only while it
 * NEEDS the relay — joining (knock/greeters), or seated in Section 1 (E3
 * re-knock keeps it in the greeter pool). A DEEP-seated seat drops its socket
 * after a grace period (the relay session cap is C²+C: the greeter pool plus
 * knock churn, not the room); it is recreated on demand the moment the seat
 * needs the relay again (a knock, or a control send with no DataChannel).
 *
 * ── S4 PER-PARTICIPANT IDENTITY (healing-laws.md S4/S5, mesh-identity.js) ──────
 * The keypair is minted HERE, once, at join. Ed25519 verification is async
 * (WebCrypto) but mesh.js's verifyFill seam is synchronous and transport-
 * agnostic, so the wire is exactly where identity belongs — the same boundary
 * that already owns all sealing/transport:
 *   - MINT: on createMeshNode we mint a per-participant identity (unless the
 *     caller supplies opts.identity, or a legacy client-set opts.peer). The
 *     peer id is peer-id = H(pubkey) — retiring the client-set-id hole.
 *   - SIGN: every occupancy-authoring frame the seat emits (FINDLEAF / PLACE /
 *     CLAIM) and the HELLO announce is signed with the participant's stable key
 *     before it goes on the wire — the signature (m.s4 = {sp,sig,pub}) is the
 *     participant's portable name, valid across links and moves.
 *   - VERIFY + PIN: an inbound signed frame is verified against the TOFU-pinned
 *     key for its signer BEFORE it reaches the seat. A good frame is delivered
 *     with m.s4ok stamped (mesh.js's verifyFill gate passes) and its key pinned;
 *     a forged/impostor/key-swapped frame is DROPPED. Verification is chained
 *     FIFO so crypto never reorders a sender's frames.
 * S4 is MANDATORY — there is no off switch: mesh-identity.js must be loaded
 * (hard fail otherwise), every node mints (or is handed) an identity, and
 * signing + verification are unconditional.

    // A blanket `else -> send it over the relay` used to sit on this line. It
    // was never a design decision; it crept in, and it did real damage:
    //
    //  1. IT LIED ABOUT LIVENESS. D1's heartbeat is how a seat learns who it
    //     can reach FIRST-HAND (E2). Delivering a PHONE over the relay
    //     manufactures liveness for a peer link that is dead, so the seat
    //     believes in a neighbour it cannot actually talk to, and healing
    //     (H1/H2/E2) — which exists to notice exactly that — is blinded.
    //  2. IT HID A REAL BUG FOR AS LONG AS IT EXISTED. Column links were not
    //     being dialled at all (see run.html renderFromOcc: a peer was only
    //     dialled once it was already `alive`, which a column mate never is
    //     until it is dialled). The fallback carried their heartbeats, so the
    //     room limped instead of failing, and nobody saw the broken link layer.
    //  3. IT INVERTED THE ECONOMICS. Every unbuilt link parked ~0.5 frames/s of
    //     heartbeat per neighbour onto one relay socket. A room whose links
    //     were mostly unbuilt pushed ~4/s through a budget a HEALTHY room uses
    //     0.3/s of — so the relay was billed for the consequences of its own
    //     splint, and the rate guard then cut the very signalling that would
    //     have built the links.
    //
    // If there is no peer path, the honest answer is SILENCE: the peer is not
    // reachable, healing must be allowed to see that, and the link layer must
    // be fixed rather than bypassed. The relay carries the entry handshake
    // (knock/greeters, and a channel-less newcomer reaching a greeter — R2)
