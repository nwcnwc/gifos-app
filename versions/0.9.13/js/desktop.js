 * to run an executable GIF in a new tab. System chrome lives in the top bar:
 * the GifOS menu (About, whole-desktop backup/restore as ONE GIF, Empty Trash,
 * dev-only Reset), an Add button (file picker + New Folder — phones can't

 * Deletes are recoverable: they move to a system Trash folder.

    'APP RULES',
    '1. The entry point is index.html. Single-file is simplest, but multi-file is fully supported: app.js, style.css, assets/… referenced normally (<script src="app.js">, <link href="style.css">) all travel inside the GIF — just include them in the files dict when packing. The ONLY hard rule: nothing external at load time. No CDNs, frameworks, remote images, or web fonts — GifOS sandboxes apps and blocks all outside network access. Inline SVG and emoji are fine. (Live data IS possible at RUNTIME: declare the hosts under capabilities.network and call gifos.fetch(url) → { ok, status, json(), text(), arrayBuffer(), blob() }. Binary is fine — an image/tile/audio body comes back byte-exact, and URL.createObjectURL(await r.blob()) gives a blob: URL an <img> or <audio> can use. For a public site/API that sends no CORS headers, pass gifos.fetch(url, { proxy:true }) to route through the GifOS CORS proxy — no key, no config. The user sees and can revoke each declared host.)',

    '     db.subscribe(items => renderFrom(items));   // called immediately and on every change',
    '   Everything in gifos.db() persists inside the icon; keep all state there and render from subscribe().',
    '2b. VISIBILITY (what an invite shares) — privacy-first, so YOU MUST DECLARE IT or nothing syncs. Each collection names a default in the manifest under "data": { "<collection>": { "visibility": "<level>" } }. Three levels:',
    '     • "read-write" — guests see AND edit it (collaborative state: a shared board, chat messages, presence). THIS is what multiplayer needs; an undeclared collection does NOT sync.',
    '     • "read-only"  — guests see it, only the host writes (broadcast: a leader\'s cursor, a shared slideshow).',
    '     • "private"    — never leaves the owner\'s tab; each participant keeps their OWN copy (personal prefs, font size, a private library). This is the DEFAULT for any collection you don\'t list.',
    '   So: split personal state (prefs) into its own PRIVATE collection, and shared state into read-write/read-only ones — never mix them in one collection. The HOST is always the authority: enforcement is host-side, so a guest can be refused but never override. To flip one record at runtime (e.g. "make this item visible", or a leader toggling "only I lead" on a shared cursor), the host calls db.setVisibility(id, level) — owner-only; it is refused on a guest. Read a record\'s current level from its reserved _vis field.',
    '   HONESTY RULE for any in-app copy about saving: there is NO cloud and NO automatic cross-device sync. Data lives on THIS device only, inside the app\'s GIF in this browser. It reaches other devices exactly two ways: live sync while people are connected through an invite link, or by sharing/downloading the GIF file itself (state travels inside the file). Never claim the app "syncs across your devices" or "backs up to the cloud" — say something true instead, like "Saved on this device inside the app\'s GIF".',

    '4. If window.gifos is undefined (opened outside GifOS), degrade gracefully to in-memory state. Mobile-friendly, dark theme (#0a0a0f) by default.',
    '4b. BACK BUTTON: the GifOS shell traps the phone\'s Back button, so a reflex press never closes your app — by default it is simply swallowed. Register gifos.onBack(() => { ... }) to make Back meaningful: close the topmost modal, back out one screen/level. Apps with internal navigation SHOULD register it.',
    '5. LIVE MEDIA IS OFF-LIMITS, by design: the sandbox blocks camera, microphone, screen capture, and WebRTC, so a video/voice/streaming app cannot work as a GifOS app — do not attempt one; if I ask for video chat, tell me GifOS already ships it (the Meeting icon on my Home Screen) — and that any app can be run INSIDE a Meeting, gaining shared audio/video/recording around it without the app touching the camera itself. Apps CAN bundle and display static media (images, GIFs, audio files) inside the GIF and store binary blobs (base64) in gifos.db — but keep hot collections lean: put big blobs (over ~100KB) in their OWN collection, fetched with db.get(), because subscribers re-download a whole collection on every change, and relay-fallback bandwidth is strictly throttled — bloated hot collections make an app slow for everyone.',

  // THE ICON'S PICTURE, AND NOTHING ELSE.
  //
  // An app is a GIF with a whole filesystem inside it and can run to hundreds of
  // megabytes, of which the icon shows only the animation — usually a 32px
  // sticker of a few kilobytes. Handing the whole file to an <img> copies every
  // one of those megabytes into a Blob and then decodes past them, once per app
  // on screen, which is most of what a Home Screen full of apps costs to paint.
  //
  // So the picture is built from the animation ALONE — normally the ornament
  // that putFile cut when the file was written, handed in by render(). The
  // strip here is the BACKSTOP for the paths that have no ornament (a page
  // without the codec, a file mid-migration): it is idempotent, so an ornament
  // passes straight through, and it makes the invariant absolute rather than
  // conventional — nothing with an app inside it ever reaches an <img>.
  //
  // Either way it removes the GifOS Application Extension whole, which every
  // GIF decoder was skipping anyway, leaving every pixel byte identical — same
  // frames, same palette, same timing. Nothing about how the icon LOOKS changes.
  //
  // This is a DISPLAY-LEVEL change and must stay one. These bytes are not the
  // app: they do not decode, they hold no manifest, no saved state, no
  // signature, and their hash is not the app's hash. Every other path —
  // run, install, export, share, sign, verify, back up, putFile — reads the
  // original bytes from the store and must continue to. That is why the strip
  // lives HERE, at the one function whose output is an <img> src, and not in

  // the name, and wraps to a second line rather than cutting.

  // indefinitely, and pays it in full the first time it is finally shown.

  // means deserialising every app, which is precisely the cost this whole change
  // exists to remove — doing it all at startup would make the first boot after
  // an update the slowest thing the computer ever did. Instead it runs AFTER
  // the first paint, when the screen is already up, one file at a time, yielding
  // between each so a big computer stays responsive throughout.
  //
  // Idempotent and safe to abandon: an interrupted sweep simply does not set the
  // stamp and runs again next boot, and any file it never reaches is still
  // repaired on sight by getArtCached. Nothing here writes a FILE — only the
  // '::art' cache beside it.
