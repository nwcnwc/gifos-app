/*
 * store.js — the App Store (store.html).
 *
 * Browses site/apps/index.json (the published catalog, built by
 * scripts/build-app-catalog.mjs) and installs an App GIF onto the Home Screen.
 *
 * THE COVER RULE — the reason this file exists in the shape it does. The store
 * NEVER references an App GIF as an image. Chess Grandmaster alone is 8.3 MB;
 * a grid that used the real GIFs as artwork would download the whole store to
 * paint one screen, on a phone, before the user has chosen anything. Every
 * picture on this page is the catalog's cover.jpg. The App GIF crosses the wire
 * exactly ONCE — inside install(), after a deliberate press. That is a network
 * property, not a style preference, so e2e-app-store.js asserts it by watching
 * requests rather than by reading this source.
 *
 * PLACEMENT — where an installed icon LANDS is not decided here. desktop.js's
 * saveItem() is the only place a desktop item may be written (it picks a free
 * cell so an arrival never stacks on an occupant). So install() stores the
 * FILE and hands off: /index.html?place=<fileId>, which desktop.js resolves
 * through saveItem like every other arrival. Adding a second placement writer
 * here is exactly the drift e2e-icon-placement.js exists to stop.

  // ---------- which build owns this visitor's Home Screen? -------------------
  // This page has NO channel loader, unlike every other entry page: a release
  // visitor would have been redirected to /versions/<current>/store.html, and
  // every snapshot cut before this feature 404s there — gifos.app/store was a
  // hard 404 for the default channel the day it shipped. So the store is
  // served from the root to everyone and works the channel out itself, using
  // the same three localStorage keys the loader reads.
  //
  // The consequence that matters is the INSTALL HAND-OFF. It finishes on
  // index.html, and a release visitor's index.html bounces them into their
  // snapshot — a snapshot whose desktop.js may know nothing about #place=. It
  // would save the file and never place the icon: a silent half-install. So we
  // ask, once, whether that build has a store; a build that has store.html is
  // by construction a build that has the handler (they shipped together).
  // Order matters, and it is the CHANNEL LOADER'S order (see index.html): a pin
  // wins everywhere, including localhost — that snapshot is the user's computer
  // and an install has to reach it. Only the DEFAULT channel is gated on the
  // real domain, because off it the root is what you're developing.
  //
  // The answer is also a BUILD NUMBER, via version.json's release→build map,
  // and that number is what the minBuild gate below compares against. It must
  // describe the computer that will RUN the app, not the page you are reading:
  // a visitor on release 0.9.5 is a build-1095 computer however new the store
  // page they are standing in happens to be.

  // store — code cut before the app it is being asked to describe existed. A
  // frozen store cannot know an app needs a build newer than itself; it read
  // the live catalog, said "Install — free", and installed something that
  // could never run. Freezing the store froze its ignorance along with it.
  //
  // Nothing was lost by staying here. The hand-off does not need this page to
  // live inside the snapshot: index.html's channel loader carries pathname AND
  // hash across its redirect, so /index.html#place=<id> lands in the pinned
  // build's desktop exactly as /versions/<rel>/index.html#place=<id> did, and
  // Open's /run.html#id=<id> the same way. What IS lost by redirecting is the

  // is older than the app in front of it.
