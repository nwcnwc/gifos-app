/*
 * mesh-pipe.js — ENCODED PASSTHROUGH for forwarded media (roadmap §9a).
 *
 * A browser cannot forward video without re-encoding it: ontrack hands you raw
 * decoded frames, so every mosaic forward in run.html silently pays a full
 * transcode — generation loss (mush), encoder latency on the critical path at
 * every hop, and one encoder PER down-link for the same picture (the watts).
 * This module removes the transcode: the compressed bytes a seat RECEIVES are
 * shipped onward untouched, and the seat decodes only once, locally, to paint
 * its own screen.
 *
 * HOW — measured on the pinned Chromium 141 (pipe-probe, 2026-08-04), because
 * the obvious designs are all silently rejected and the working one is not
 * guessable:
 *   - Cross-transformer injection NEVER ships. Writing a received frame (or
 *     any constructed clone — even one built from this sender's own frame via
 *     the RTCEncodedVideoFrame constructor) into a sender's writable resolves
 *     the write promise and delivers NOTHING: the sink accepts only the exact
 *     frame objects it handed out of this transformer's readable. Measured:
 *     59-60 writes, 0 packets, no error, four variants.
 *   - Payload SWAP on the sender's own frames ships fine, and packetization is
 *     content-agnostic (doubled bytes shipped; zeroed bytes shipped). So: run
 *     a TINY dummy encoder on this sender as a frame-TEMPLATE mint, and put
 *     the forwarded bytes into its frames. ~32px templates ≈ hundreds of times
 *     less encode work than re-encoding the content.
 *   - COPY EARLY. Writing a frame onward (even to its own local decoder pipe)
 *     DETACHES frame.data — a stashed frame object reads back empty. Bytes are
 *     copied the moment a frame is seen, before anything else touches it.
 *   - TYPE-MATCH or the descriptor lies. A keyframe's bytes on a delta-typed
 *     template make the depacketizer mislabel the frame and the far decoder
 *     rejects the stream. Content frames queue FIFO (reference chains — never
 *     skip); key content waits for a key template. The far end's normal PLI
 *     reaches THIS hop's dummy encoder and mints key templates on demand, so
 *     the wait is one RTCP round trip, not a policy.
 *   - Sender-side transformer.generateKeyFrame() DOES NOT EXIST here (kfA:
 *     'absent'), but receiver-side transformer.sendKeyFrameRequest() DOES
 *     (measured 2026-08-04: a key lands in 21-72ms from camera, canvas and
 *     carrier upstreams alike) — and WebRTC emits NO periodic keyframes at
 *     all (1 key in 20s of healthy flow: the initial one), so every key must
 *     be ASKED for. The tap asks its own upstream hop-locally whenever a
 *     routed pipe needs key content (route, unpause, overflow, drop streaks,
 *     the consumer-PLI tunnel); at a piped upstream the resulting key
 *     template against a delta-only queue re-fires the same ask THERE, so
 *     the request chains hop-by-hop to the producer's real encoder entirely
 *     in RTCP + worker logic. The 'kf-need' page event remains as fallback
 *     (no-SKR browsers) — its old primary role, a DC walk up the claim chain
 *     ending in a producer-side capture nudge, is what FROZE whole rooms
 *     when the producer was a blur pipe (the stg freeze, frza runs).
 *   - CODEC GUARD at runtime, not SDP: every encoded frame's metadata carries
 *     mimeType. The worker compares content vs template per-pipe and reports a
 *     mismatch so the page can fall back to the transcode path for that job.
 *     (The pinned test Chromium has NO H.264 — everything negotiates VP8 — so
 *     H264-vs-VP8 splits are a production-Chrome concern the guard must catch.)
 *
 * Verified end-to-end on this machinery: 96 writes -> 98 packets -> 96 frames
 * at the consumer -> 59 decoded, 96% byte-identical to the producer's encoder
 * output. The consumer rendered the producer's true pixels through a relay
 * that never ran a content encoder.
 *
 * SHAPE: one shared Worker; transforms attach per-receiver ('tap') and
 * per-sender ('pipe'); a routing table fans one tap to N pipes — which is the
 * one-encoder fan (§9b) falling out for free: N forwards of one feed cost N
 * tiny template mints and ZERO content encodes.
 *
 * The page-side API is deliberately dumb plumbing (attach, route, carrier,
 * stats); every policy decision — which jobs pipe, when to fall back, how
 * kf-need travels — belongs to run.html, next to the rest of the mosaic law.

  // captureStream(0) carrier, so across PIPED hops the SKR chain dies at the
  // first carrier (measured: startup stalls healed in 145-185s instead of
  // seconds — the ask never crossed the first piped upstream). The kf-need
  // page walk (mx-kf over the DC, hop-by-hop to the producer, resolved by
  // the sender-side jiggle) is the mechanism that crosses piped hops — it is
  // NOT a fallback, it is the primary for deep chains. Fire both; the page
  // rate-limits the walk per key (2s) and skrLast bounds the RTCP side.
  // ONE TAP FEEDS MANY PIPES, AND THE WALK IS PER PIPE.
  //
  // skrLast is keyed by srcId — the TAP — which is right for the RTCP side: one
  // PLI upstream serves every pipe hanging off that tap, so bounding it per tap
  // is the whole point. It was ALSO gating the kf-need walk, which is per PIPE,

  // insertion order, so the SAME pipe wins every tick forever and a sibling
  // that needs a key can never ask for one. It stays needKey, drops all delta
  // content, and its receiver bright-freezes while the winner plays perfectly.
  //
  // That is the shape measured all along: one sender, one feed, two
  // destinations, 26-of-32 frames decoded at one and 1-of-32 at the other; and

  // requestFrame round trip occasionally loses a beat, so a STANDING deficit
  // accumulates (+1 queued frame per ~16 content frames, measured) until QMAX
  // overflow re-keys the whole downstream. Extra mints must live in SEPARATE
  // tasks (same-task requestFrames coalesce into one capture), so a 33ms tick
  // mints one catch-up template per backlogged pipe until the report drains.
  // Idle safety: a report older than 1s is stale (content stopped — its wants
  // stopped too); an over-minted delta template is dropped free at the
  // worker's idle-queue gate.
  // MEASUREMENT LEVER (2026-08-10, docs/bug-pipe-stg-freeze-2026-08-05.md).
  // The drainer is the only thing that mints BEYOND 1-for-1 demand, and the
  // stg-freeze chain profile found the over-mint ratio tracking decode failure
  // almost perfectly: at one stall, mints/wants of 1.00 decoded 29 of 29, 1.03
  // decoded 15 of 31, and 1.26 decoded 4 of 30. Dropping an over-minted delta
  // in the WORKER does not un-mint the canvas frame — Chrome still encodes and
  // sends it, carrying no swapped payload — so the suspicion is that catch-up
