/*
 * gifos-themes.js — the theme cascade loader.
 *
 * A THEME is just a folder of files. The DEFAULT theme lives in /themes; each
 * computer overrides it with a /themes/<subdomain>/ folder named after its
 * subdomain label (0.gifos.app → themes/0, neon.gifos.app → themes/neon).
 * Resolution is per-file: a subdomain uses /themes/<label>/<file> when that file
 * exists, and falls back to /themes/<file> when it doesn't. So:
 *
 *   RESKIN a live computer  =  edit its themes/<label>/ folder, push (Pages).
 *   ADD a NEW computer      =  drop a themes/<label>/ folder AND add its route
 *                              to mirror/wrangler.toml, then `wrangler deploy`.
 *                              (Routes are an explicit allow-list — no wildcard,
 *                              so nobody can spin up infinite subdomains.)
 *     themes/theme.js   themes/icons.js          ← the default look (Aurora)
 *     themes/7/theme.js themes/7/icons.js        ← override for 7.gifos.app
 *
 * A theme folder holds (all optional; omit one and the base file is used):
 *   theme.js      — calls GifOS.setTheme({ name, pack, chrome:{cssVar:value} })
 *   icons.js      — the icon-art pack (registers with GifOS.iconPacks)
 *   eggs.js       — bonus seed apps for THIS computer only: GifOS.addEggs([...])
 *   wallpaper.js  — a live background (e.g. a WebGL canvas) for THIS computer.
 *                   Drop the file in and the cascade loads it — no per-theme
 *                   injection. It should self-guard duplicates, honour
 *                   prefers-reduced-motion, pause when hidden, and sit behind the
 *                   icons (a fixed canvas at z-index 0, pointer-events:none).
 *
 * All themes seed the SAME default apps (from sample-apps.js), automatically
 * dressed in the theme — icons.js draws their animated icons in-style and the
 * chrome vars colour their HTML. eggs.js is the seam for extras that exist on
 * one digit only; the seeder files each into a named folder (Games, Tools, …).
 *
 * Loading is a parser-blocking base-then-override document.write, so chrome
 * lands BEFORE first paint (no flash) and a missing override file just 404s and
 * leaves the base in place. icons.js + eggs.js + wallpaper.js are only pulled on
 * the DESKTOP, never on the meeting/app pages (art is baked into GIFs there, and
 * a wallpaper behind an occluded call would just burn battery). wallpaper.js is
 * also OVERRIDE-only — there is no default wallpaper, so the base themes/ folder
 * is never asked for one.
 *
 * TWO-PASS LOADING: "before first paint" is only true if this file itself runs
 * before first paint — and at the end of <body> it doesn't: on a cold cache the
 * theme-gate's 1.5s failsafe fired first and revealed the purple :root
 * baseline, which then visibly snapped to the real theme (the first-visit
 * flash). So the entry pages now include this file TWICE: once in <head>
 * (before the stylesheet — writes ONLY theme.js, so chrome vars truly land
 * before any paint), and the desktop pages again at the end of <body>, after
 * gifos-icons.js (writes ONLY the art: icons/eggs/wallpaper). The passes are
 * told apart by GifOS._themePass; a page that includes the file just once —
 * every frozen /versions/ snapshot, or a plain single include after
 * gifos-icons.js — still gets the original single-pass behaviour, because the
 * first pass always writes theme.js and writes the art whenever iconPacks is
 * already there.
